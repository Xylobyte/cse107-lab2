# CSE107 - Lab 2

***

This lab utilizes loop statemets such as **for** and **while**
as well as conditional statements like **if** and **else**.
It also employs the use of the turtle library.

## Purpose

***

### pay.py

This program calculates the pay of an employee based on inputted
employee type and other parameters.

### calculator.py

This program uses the math library to do an operation on a given 
number based on the desired operation inputted.

### polygons2.py

This program uses the turtle library to draw a shape of the given
number of sides and side-length.

## Conclusion

***

* In this lab I practiced implementing looping and conditional
statements to solve problems that require them. I learned the 
proper syntax and common practices of these statements for python.
* Pair programming aided in giving me an outside look at my code
and allowed me to ask questions and give help to my partner when
it was needed.
* I did not work with my buddy on the lab.
* I did not encounter any problems when doing this lab other than
minor syntax errors which were easily fixed.
* I think I could improve the way I did the calculations in 
[pay.py](#paypy); specifically the employee. I think that instead 
of using an if statement to check for more than 40 hours the pay 
can be calculated in one line.
